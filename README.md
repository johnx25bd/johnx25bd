# Hey, I'm John

I work at complex intersections — emerging tech and real-world systems, deep technical work and strategy, code, data and policy.

Some highlights:
- co-founded Toucan Protocol (carbon markets infrastructure, $4B+ volume)
- launched the OS Data Hub at Ordnance Survey
- built maritime security data systems used by the UN
- taught smart contract engineering
- contributed to research at the WEF and OGC.

I'm currently building [Astral](https://astral.global) (decentralized geospatial systems) and researching location verification at the University of Maryland.

## Work

**Toucan Protocol** — Co-founder. I led ecosystem growth, supported protocol architecture design, scaled the team, and built partnerships. Our infrastructure captured 50%+ of voluntary carbon market trading volume.

**Ordnance Survey** — I launched the OS Data Hub, opening UK national mapping data under a £1B government licensing agreement.

**Machine Learning Institute** — I built deep learning systems, data pipelines, and taught technical teams.

**One Earth Future** — I built maritime security data infrastructure that reached UN and IMO policy work.

I also co-chaired the WEF Web3 Climate Action working group, advised innovation startups at Lloyd's of London, and am involved in the Open Geospatial Consortium.

## Tech

Python, TypeScript, SQL, PostGIS, MapLibre, machine learning systems, smart contracts, data pipelines, geospatial analysis.
